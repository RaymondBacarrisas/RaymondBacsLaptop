margin: auto;		- set element in center
Tertiary colors		- are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. 
hsl(0, 100%, 50%)	- Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. 
			CSS3 introduced the hsl() property as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

				~ Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. 
				If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle,
				and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept 
				instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.
				~ Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally 
				saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.
				~ Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black)
				to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.
background: linear-gradient(35deg, #CCFFFF, #FFCCCC);
			- Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. 
			CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. 
			This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. 
p {  transform:scale(2); }	-To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function. 
				The following code example doubles the size of all the paragraph elements on the page
a:hover			- psuedo class	
p {transform: skewX(-32deg);}	- The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected 
				element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.
